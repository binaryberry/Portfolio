List of projects I've built during and after [Makers Academy].

First introduction to Ruby - my humble beginnings
-----------
 - [Student Directory] - My first programme. A Terminal app allowing to input and display a list of students.
 - [Roman Numerals] - My first kata! Loads of TDD-ed fun.
 - [Fizzbuzz] - Redone several times to get used to TDD.

Learning Object-Oriented Design and Testing
-----------
- [Supermarket] - Initially just an exercise to get a grasp of CRC cards, but I coded it for fun!
- [Airport] - a weekend challenge
- [Boris Bikes] - A more complex version of Airport
- [Battleships] - First experience working in a team (5 people). Went well!

Learning about Servers, Sessions, and CSS
-----------
  - [Bookmark Collector] - A Ruby/Sinatra app, using Mailgun to reset password
  - [Cowboy Ninja Bear] - A Javascript app, an alternative version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, my first experience of Heroku
  - [Wunderlist] - A Nina-Simone themed To-Do list, playing "do what you gotta do" when you launch it. My first experience using jQuery and Node.js.

Experimenting
--------------
  - [Io] - One day of learning Io
  - [Metaprogramming] -  One day of doing Ruby metaprogramming
  - [Ruby refresher] - Week 8 challenge at Makers Academy
